§ Boomerang (Song), By Marni Nixon

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

When I was very young, living in (I think) Port Moody, there was a //TV show// that I watched (which was meant for kids) called “Boomerang”.
I have learned that this show was created by **Marni Nixon** (who is probably most famous for her singing — specifically as being the singing voice dubbed over various actresses in various movies).

I have learned that the show was very local.
And, unless you lived in Washington State or BC, Canada in the 1970s, then you probably didn't see it, and never heard of it.

§§ Lyrics

The theme song to it that was very memorable.
It was a "duet" sung between her and a group of children.

From what I could figure, the words of the theme song are something like....

― B Boom Boom 
― B Boom Boom 
― Bees keep on flying 'round the room 
― M E Mer 
― M E Mer 
― Mother will help me if I ask her 
― R Ra Ran 
― R Ra Ran 
― I will run faster than they can 
― Ra Ran Rang 
― Ra Ran Rang 
― Put them together, it's boomerang! 
―  
― Bing bong bang 
― Bing bong bang 
― Bing bong bang it's boomerang 
― Bing bong bang 
― Bing bong bang 
― Bing bong bang it's boomerang 
―  
― A boomerang 
― A boomerang 
― What does it do? 
― What does it do?! 
― It comes back to you. 
― It comes back to you. 
― A boomerang 
― A boomerang 
― Bing bong bang it's boomerang 
―  
― Your throw a ball against the wall, and what does it do? 
― It comes back to you, like a boomerang. 
― Boomerang 
― Bing bong bang it's boomerang 
― We all have seen a trampoline, where you bounce so high, 
― And back down you go, like a boomerang 
― Boomerang 
― Bing bong bang it's boomerang 
―  
― It's a funny looking thing 
― Something like an airplane wing 
― And when you throw it, ever so high 
― So high it seems to hide in the sky 
― It fools you with its special knack, of turning around and falling back 
―  
― A boomerang 
― A boomerang 
― What does it do? 
― What does it do?! 
― It comes back to you. 
― It comes back to you. 
― A boomerang 
― A boomerang 
― Bing bong bang it's boomerang 

Note, when the group of kids is singing, it sounds like some of them are saying “put those together, it's boomerang” instead of “put them together, it's boomerang”.

Also, it sounds like some of the kids are saying “that's a boomerang” instead of “it's a boomerang”.

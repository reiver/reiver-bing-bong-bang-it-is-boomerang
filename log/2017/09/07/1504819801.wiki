As a young child, Charles Iliya Krempeaux watched the //Boomerang// TV show created by Marni Nixon (i.e., Margaret Nixon).
The very memorable [[boomerang-song]] — which was the intro theme song to the //Boomerang// TV show — is still //sticky music// for him.
He has also played the [[boomerang-song]] for his children (who also seem to enjoy it).

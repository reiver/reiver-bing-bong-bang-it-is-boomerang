From //Humuhumu// from ``http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/04/06/bing-bong-bang-its-boomerang/``:

― Just when you think that the Internet holds all the answers, it fails you.
― My search for information about Boomerang, a ’70s kids’ TV show from my native Seattle, has turned up nearly bupkes.
― 
― I did learn something very interesting… I had no idea that Marni, the host of Boomerang, was none other than Marni Nixon.
― 
― Nixon is the reason Julie Andrews won her Oscar for Mary Poppins.
― Well, that’s not fair — that was a well-earned Oscar.
― (Those who already know this story can skip ahead a couple of paragraphs.)
― Julie Andrews had starred on Broadway in the hit musical My Fair Lady, and won a Tony award.
― But when My Fair Lady was turned into a Hollywood film, Julie Andrews was not yet a name movie-goers would recognize, and Warner Brothers cast Audrey Hepburn in what really should have been Julie Andrews’ role.
― Walt Disney knew better, and cast Andrews that same year in Mary Poppins.
― Mary Poppins, and Julie Andrews, became a smash sensation.
― 
― When the press started to dig a bit, and learned that Audrey Hepburn didn’t actually sing her parts — that the beautiful voice behind “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly” and “I Could Have Danced All Night” was actually Marni Nixon… well, Jack Warner started to look like a fool for having ditched Julie Andrews.
― In Julie Andrews’ Oscar acceptance speech for Mary Poppins, she thanked “the man who made this all possible… Jack Warner,” which makes me love Julie Andrews even more.
― 
― Marni actually has a brief role in Mary Poppins, as one of the animated geese, but didn’t meet Andrews while working on that film.
― When Nixon and Andrews later worked together on The Sound of Music (Nixon played one of the nuns), Andrews introduced herself with a hearty handshake, and exclaimed “I really love your work!,” probably with a cheeky look in her eye.
― Marni also was the singing voice for Maria in West Side Story, and she did some vocal work for a Mr. Magoo album, “Magoo in Hi-Fi” and provided “ethereal voice effects” for some Esquivel albums.
― She was a very, very successful session singer in Hollywood.
― 
― I’m still having trouble reconciling the host of Boomerang with this Hollywood figure, but it comes together a bit when I hear the Boomerang theme song again — the song’s not exactly a winner, but it sure brings back memories, and that voice is loverly:

― 
― This still leaves plenty of holes about Boomerang the show, though.
― I can fill in a little bit more from my own memories: It aired on channel 4, KOMO, which was Seattle’s ABC affiliate.
― It was filmed during the late ’70s into the early ’80s, and continued on in reruns for a while.
― Marni’s co-star was a yellow puppet boy, who looked like a cross between Bert from Sesame Street and Terrence from South Park.
― I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶’̶t̶ ̶r̶e̶m̶e̶m̶b̶e̶r̶ ̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶n̶a̶m̶e̶,̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶I̶ ̶c̶o̶u̶l̶d̶n̶’̶t̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶o̶n̶l̶i̶n̶e̶.̶
― His name was Norbert.
― (Thanks melberoo!)
― There’s one episode in particular that I remember, where Marni was hired to do a commercial for some silver polish, but she tries the polish and it doesn’t work very well, and she decides to not do the commercial.
― It was a lesson about not whoring oneself out, and whenever I’m faced with similar scenarios, I always think of Marni’s frustration with the silver polish.
― Overall, the show was on the schmaltzy side, and if we’d had the variety of cable back then, I probably would never have watched it.
― 
― So anywhere, there you go.
― That’s all I could find about the Seattle show Boomerang.
― Maybe someday something more will show up.

As a young child, Charles Iliya Krempeaux watched the //Boomerang// TV show created by Marni Nixon (i.e., Margaret Nixon).
The very memorable [[boomerang-song]] — which was the intro theme song to the //Boomerang// TV show — is still //sticky music// for him.
He has also played the [[boomerang-song]] for his children (who also seem to enjoy it).
